## My First Working Laravel Application

This was my first functional web application made some time around the end of 2013, using Laravel 4.1 and a bit of Bootstrap.

At the time I had no understanding of testing and a somewhat basic understanding of Object Oriented design patterns and principles.

I'm keeping this here more as a reference of past work and as a point to which more current projects can be compared.
